      <p>
        {config.brandName} is committed to promoting responsible gambling. Gambling should be a form
        of entertainment — never a way to make money or escape problems. You must be{' '}
        <strong>18+</strong> (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) to participate.
      </p>

      <h2>Stay in control</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only gamble with money you can afford to lose.</li>
        <li>Set deposit, loss, and time limits before you play — and stick to them.</li>
        <li>Never chase your losses.</li>
        <li>Don’t gamble when stressed, upset, or under the influence.</li>
        <li>Treat gambling as paid entertainment, not income.</li>
        <li>Take regular breaks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Warning signs</h2>
      <p>Gambling may be becoming a problem if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spend more time or money than you intended.</li>
        <li>Gamble to recover losses or to win back money.</li>
        <li>Borrow money or sell things to gamble.</li>
        <li>Lie about or hide your gambling.</li>
        <li>Feel anxious, guilty, or irritable about gambling.</li>
        <li>Neglect work, studies, family, or friends because of gambling.</li>
      </ul>
